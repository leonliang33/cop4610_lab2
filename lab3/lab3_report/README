From a first fit algorithm:
Amount Free | Amount claimed
583584         145
606102         175

From Best-Fit Algorithm:
Amount Free    | Amount claimed
197409              132
197978              136

We can see from this that the fragmentation from Best fit is less than one from first fit algorithm.
The amount claimed is the same on both however the amount free on first fit is significantly larger than
the best fit algorithm.
However one downside to this is that best-fit would take more time and took longer than first-fit.
